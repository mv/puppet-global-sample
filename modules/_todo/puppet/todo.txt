    # An external command that can produce node information.  The output
    # must be a YAML dump of a hash, and that hash must have one or both of
    # `classes` and `parameters`, where `classes` is an array and
    # `parameters` is a hash.  For unknown nodes, the commands should
    # exit with a non-zero exit code.
    # This command makes it straightforward to store your node mapping
    # information in other data sources like databases.
    # The default value is 'none'.
